# Tiny Tapeout Ring Oscillator with Enable and Counter

This repo contains the tiny tapeout verilog design of a ring oscillator with enable functionality and a built in 15-bit counter for tallying the number of oscillations, and chain tap functionality.

The ring oscillator that sits at the center of this design was based upon that done by algofoogle in: [tt09-ring-osc3](https://github.com/algofoogle/tt09-ring-osc3)

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This variable tap ring oscillator with a built-in counter and enable was made by a ECE undergraduate project team at Vanderbilt University through the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.
